# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT

This deep learning project uses TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories.

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 (60,000 images, 10 classes)

## Tools
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Model Overview
- 3 Convolution layers
- 2 MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected Dense layer
- Softmax output for 10 classes

## Output
Trains the model and visualizes Accuracy and Loss plots.
